        I love to work on design systems and pattern libraries, and delivering
        tools and processes focused on the transition from idea to design to
        code. I'm currently a Senior Engineer at Jeli by PagerDuty, an incident
        managment and learning tool. I've worked on a variety of products and
        team sizes, from operating as the only frontend engineer on the launch
        of Ro's Mental Health offering, Ro Mind, to managing the front-end team
        at Tracer, a marketing data aggregation and analytics platform.

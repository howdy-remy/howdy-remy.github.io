    In 2012, Colloquy, the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences’ Alumni
    magazine came to Visual Dialogue for a much needed redesign. I contributed
    to the initial update to the look and feel, typography, layout, and
    organization. After completing the redesign I worked on visual concepts,
    typographic treatments, typesetting and preparing files for print for 12
    issues."

      We chose our favorite outtakes from a photoshoot, or an unexpected find
      from the photo archive, to place front and center on the first spread to
      set the tone for the rest of the issue.

    <ProjectText>
      An emphasis on including good photography, popular illustrators, and
      thoughtful type lockups was key to elevating <i>Colloquy’s</i> design and distance
      it from the usual alumni magazine look and feel.

                    In 2012, Colloquy, the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences’ Alumni magazine came to Visual Dialogue for a much needed redesign. I contributed to the initial update to the look and feel, typography, layout, and organization and have since worked on visual concepts, typographic treatments, typesetting and preparing files for print for 12 issues.

                        We chose our favorite outtakes from a photoshoot, or an unexpected find from the photo archive, to place front and center on the first spread to set the tone for the rest of the issue.

                    An emphasis on including good photography, popular illustrators, and thoughtful type lockups was key to elevating <i>Colloquy’s</i> design and distance it from the usual alumni magazine look and feel.

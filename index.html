                            1630, Proprietors of Boston Goods &amp; Curiosities, is a ‘pop-up shoppe’ that features goods created by New England makers, curated antiques, and smart, Boston-themed merchandise. To give the pop-up shop a more permanent home online I took the design provided by the team and built it using Kirby CMS with PHP, HTML, CSS, and a little bit of jQuery, with responsive practices and SEO in mind.

                            Upon reaching its 40th year of publication, diacritics, a quarterly “review of contemporary criticism” by Cornell University, felt it needed a refresh to the design. The first step was to bring back the logotype from the very first issue in 1971. We then took that retro (in a great way) logo and paired it with type from Hoefler &amp; Co. and a clean, modern layout that is as bold as the essays in each issue. Following the initial redesign I have typeset and produced print-ready files for 13 issues.

Once we outgrew that platform I redeveloped a responsive version using PHP, HTML, CSS and jQuery using [Kirby CMS](http://getkirby.com).

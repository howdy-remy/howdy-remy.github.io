            <h3>1630</h3>
            <p class='project__description'>
              1630, Proprietors of Boston Goods & Curiosities, is a ‘pop-up shoppe’ that features goods created by New England makers, curated antiques, and smart, Boston-themed merchandise. To give the pop-up shop a more permanent home online I took the design provided by the team and built it using Kirby CMS with PHP, HTML, CSS, a skosh of jQuery, and a custom Shopify theme using Liquid, all with responsive practices and SEO in mind.

            <h3>Diacritics</h3>
            <p class='project__description'>
              Upon reaching its 40th year of publication, Diacritics, a quarterly “review of contemporary criticism” by Cornell University, felt they needed a more contemporary design. As they say “style is cyclical”, so we dusted off the incredible logotype from the very first issue in 1971 and paired it with type from Hoefler & Co. and a clean, modern layout that is as bold as the essays in each issue. Following the initial redesign, I typeset and produced print-ready files for 13 issues.

            <h3>Colloquy</h3>
            <p class='project__description'>
              In 2012, Colloquy, the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences’ Alumni magazine came to Visual Dialogue for a much needed redesign. I contributed to the initial update to the look and feel, typography, layout, and organization. After completing the redesign I worked on visual concepts, typographic treatments, typesetting and preparing files for print for 12 issues.

            <h3>Visual Dialogue</h3>
            <p class='project__description'>
              When I joined Visual Dialogue in 2011 their website was still in Flash and XML. It was a pain to update, looked dated, and didn’t work with the screen sizes of the time (bigger or smaller). I helped design the new layout and initially built out a customized theme in Cargo Collective. Once we outgrew that platform I redeveloped a responsive version using PHP, HTML, CSS and jQuery using Kirby CMS that they still use today.

                    Two large format, special edition collections for Smithsonian Folkways Recordings. <i>Woody at 100: The Woody Guthrie Centennial Collection</i> commemorates Woody’s 100th birthday with a 150-page, 12x12 book which includes essays about his life, photos, his drawings, and 57 tracks on 3 CDs. <i>Lead Belly: The Smithsonian Folkways Collection</i> was released two years later in the same format and focuses on the life and music of Huddie Ledbetter.

                    <p class='project__description'>
                    <i>Woody at 100</i> went on to win a Grammy in 2013 for design in the Best Boxed Set or Limited Edition Package category.

                        1630, Proprietors of Boston Goods & Curiosities, is a ‘pop-up shoppe’ that features goods created by New England makers, curated antiques, and smart, Boston-themed merchandise. To give the pop-up shop a more permanent home online I took the design provided by the team and built it using Kirby CMS with PHP, HTML, CSS, and a skosh of jQuery, a custom Shopify theme using Liquid, all with responsive practices and SEO in mind.

                    <p class='project__description'>
                        Upon reaching its 40th year of publication, diacritics, a quarterly “review of contemporary criticism” by Cornell University, felt they needed a more contemporary design. As they say “style is cyclical”, so we dusted off the incredible logotype from the very first issue in 1971 and paired it with type from Hoefler & Co. and a clean, modern layout that is as bold as the essays in each issue. Following the initial redesign, I typeset and produced print-ready files for 13 issues.

                    In 2012, Colloquy, the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences’ Alumni magazine came to Visual Dialogue for a much needed redesign. I contributed to the initial update to the look and feel, typography, layout, and organization and have since worked on visual concepts, typographic treatments, typesetting and preparing files for print for 12 issues.

                        When I joined Visual Dialogue in 2011 their website was still in Flash and XML. It was a pain to update, looked dated, and didn’t work with the screen sizes of the time (bigger or smaller). I helped design the new layout and initially built out a customized theme in Cargo Collective. Once we outgrew that platform I redeveloped a responsive version using PHP, HTML, CSS and jQuery using [Kirby CMS](http://getkirby.com) that they still use today.

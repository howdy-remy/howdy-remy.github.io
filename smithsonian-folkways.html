                    Two large format, special edition collections for Smithsonian Folkways Recordings. <i>Woody at 100: The Woody Guthrie Centennial Collection</i> commemorates Woody’s 100th birthday with a 150-page, 12x12 book which includes essays about his life, photos, his drawings, and 57 tracks on 3 CDs. <i>Lead Belly: The Smithsonian Folkways Collection</i> was released two years later in the same format and focuses on the life and music of Huddie Ledbetter.

                    <i>Woody at 100</i> went on to win a Grammy in 2013 for design in the Best Boxed Set or Limited Edition Package category.

                    Even though <i>diacritics</i> began as very forward thinking and flexible with their design it was almost scandelous to suggest that we add pull quotes. I’m glad we got away with it because they’re a crucial part of the redesign. They help with scanning the dense material, emphasizing important concepts, and break up the monotony of the solid blocks of text on the page.
